Hello you legends! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dom and I am a budding software engineer. 
Fresh off a bootcamp with Lewagon, I'm now looking to further develop my skills and secure my first software development job. 

Depending on the time of the year, you'll find me in Barcelona or Cape Town spending my time learning new coding skills or somewhere in the mountains connecting with nature. If you're in the area, don't be shy to reach out ðŸ‘¯
